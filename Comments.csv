good camera.,"This app is unusable. It freezes every time I try to open it, and the updates have only made things worse."
works just fine thank you .,"After the latest update, the device stopped working properly. It’s extremely slow and often unresponsive."
"The camera quality is quite disappointing; the pictures are grainy, the autofocus is slow, and the colors look washed out.","This is nothing like what was shown on the website. The quality is poor, and it doesn’t perform as promised."
"The product arrived later than expected, and the packaging was damaged, which was really disappointing.",The price for this product is outrageous given the low quality. I found similar items for half the price elsewhere.
"memory card is too short and small it did not meet my expectations.
what is wrong with the memory card what a waste of time.","This is overpriced for what it is. The value doesn’t justify the cost, and I regret spending so much on it."
what is wrong with the memory card what a waste of time.,
"There are some software problems, and the memory card ended up getting corrupted.",
"The battery life is terrible. It barely lasts an hour before needing to be recharged, making it unreliable for extended use.",
"The camera frequently freezes, and I have to reset it to get it working again. The software is clearly buggy.",
